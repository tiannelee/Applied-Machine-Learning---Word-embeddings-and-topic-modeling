    "1. In terms of quality of the embeddings, from our example exploring that indian is analogous to flat bread if French is analogous to Baguette shows that the embedding is being able to pick up strong similarity like these. However not all similarity is good if they represent stereotypes and biases that can harm the society. When an embedding like this is deployed in essential things like court, healthcare, high similarity between words should not be the main thing to look out for, instead it needs to reflect a just system. Hence, overall even though for most examples the quality of these pre-trained embeddings is quite good, it needs to undergo a lot more de-biasing to be a high quality non-stereotypical embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A model that outputs gender stereotype reinforcing analogy can be harmful in the real world in many ways. For example, if students were to search up career options and the information they receive was man to programmer is like woman to homemaking, female students could potentially be discourage to pursue in the STEM related field. Similarly, an aspiring nursing male could have easily find the result that the similarity between the word \"man\" and \"nurse\" is way lower that of the female counterpart. These are both examples of why pre-trained word embedding models should be carefully handled and debiased."

    "Average embedding can hence use similar words to find similarity for text classification and can detect word semantic differences where countvectorizer is limited. \n",
    "2. The CountVectorizer approach is more interpretable since word representations in average embedding can be difficult to interpret in terms of similarity since it is based on frequency of counts.\n",
    "3. Yes we are using transfer learning by using spacy's pre trained model. There is no significant difference in the testing scores in the classification report between the transfer learning's average embedding approach and CountVectorizer so we are not really observing the benefits (the f1 score is slightly lower in the embedding). \n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise you'll prepare the data for topic modeling using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). Preprocessing is a crucial step before training an LDA model and it markedly affects topic modeling results. So let's carry out preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to carry out preprocessing of the \"text\" column in the dataframe above and store the preprocessed text in a new column called \"text_pp\" in the dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no such thing as \"perfect\" preprocessing. You'll have to make your own judgments and decisions on which tokens are more informative and which ones are less informative for the given task. Some common text preprocessing steps for topic modeling are: \n",
    "- getting rid of slashes or other weird characters\n",
    "- sentence segmentation and tokenization      \n",
    "- getting rid of urls and email addresses\n",
    "- getting rid of other fairly unique tokens which are not going to help us in topic modeling  \n",
    "- excluding stopwords and punctuation \n",
    "- lemmatization        \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to go back and forth between the preprocessing and topic modeling and interpretation steps in the next exercises. \n",

    "> Check out [these available attributes](https://spacy.io/api/token#attributes) for `token` in spaCy which might help you with preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also get rid of words with specific POS tags. [Here](https://spacy.io/api/annotation/#pos-en) is the list of part-of-speech tags used in spaCy. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that preprocessing the corpus might take some time. So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you're done with the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook. \n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In transfer learning, a pre-trained model is repurposed for our task. Usually most of the layers have their hyperparameters optimized which makes it simpler to deploy in a new similar task. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three common ways to use transfer learning in computer vision:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using pre-trained models out-of-the-box\n",
    "- Using pre-trained models as feature extractor and training your own model with these features\n",
    "- Starting with weights of pre-trained models and fine-tuning the weights for your task.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a transfer learning neural network, latent features were easily extracted without having to optimize complicated hyperparameters. The resulting features were then easily used to train our model in lecture to give output for specific classification of images according to the task. This saves time and resources to optimize hyperparameters and hence makes ML approaches more easy to use."
